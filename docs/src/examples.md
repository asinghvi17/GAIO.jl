# How to Use

To see examples of how to use GAIO.jl explore the [examples folder](https://github.com/gaioguys/GAIO.jl/tree/master/examples). This contains a `Project.toml` file that can be used to download all the necessary dependencies for the examples. 

To try the examples, one can choose between two options:
* (recommended) simply download an example file and see what packages are used, add them in the package manager
* clone the [GAIO.jl GitHub repository](https://github.com/gaioguys/GAIO.jl.git). Navigate to the repository folder `/path/to/GAIO.jl/examples` in the julia REPL using `pwd` and `cd`. Finally, call the following in the julia REPL
```julia
pkg> activate .
julia> pwd()
"/path/to/GAIO.jl"

julia> cd("./examples")

(GAIO) pkg> activate .
